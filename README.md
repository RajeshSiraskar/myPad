myPad - is my writing pad

I will put in my thoughts here:

1. 08-Dec-16: I learn about Digital Twins!! Excellent concept.
2. 08-Dec-16: Played tennis for about an hour
3. 08-Dec-16: Am also learning to use git! Geeky stuff this git. Learning to 'branch', then make changes in the branch and submit a 'pull request'. This will make me ready for PACCAR's git usage
